# BikeStore-AnalysisðŸ“Š
## Step One
- Create a database called "BikeStores" and import the dataset.
  The dataset cintains 9 tables:
  #### Dataset Source: **[BikeStores Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ESMiCguVJjUzjVNxLffngDrHsQcMFHrt/edit#gid=1194135803)**


  

## Step Two
After create a datapase called BikeStores and creates the tables and insert to each table the value needded;
I wrote an SQL script that generated a dataset with fields consistent of: 
- Order ID, Customer's first and last name, Customer's city and state,the order date,sales volume, revenue, product's name and category, store name and sales rep.

These fields are scatterd across nearly 9 separate but related tables in the BikeStores database, 
so I performed a series of direct and indirect table joins to generate teh dataset
